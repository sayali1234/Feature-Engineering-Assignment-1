    "The Filter method is a popular technique in feature selection used to select relevant features from a dataset based on their statistical properties. It involves \n",
    "calculating statistical scores for each feature in the dataset and selecting the top-ranked features based on these scores. The main idea behind this method is to\n",
    "use statistical measures to evaluate the relevance of each feature independently of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the general steps for applying the Filter method for feature selection:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Choose a statistical measure: There are various statistical measures that can be used to evaluate the relevance of a feature. Commonly used measures include\n",
    "Pearson correlation coefficient, chi-squared test, mutual information, and ANOVA F-test. The choice of measure depends on the type of data and the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Calculate the statistical score for each feature: For each feature in the dataset, the chosen statistical measure is computed between the feature and the target\n",
    "variable. The result is a statistical score that reflects the relevance of the feature to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Rank the features based on their scores: The features are then ranked based on their statistical scores, from the most relevant to the least relevant. The\n",
    "top-ranked features are considered the most important for the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Select the top-ranked features: Finally, a fixed number of top-ranked features or a certain percentage of the total number of features can be selected as the \n",

    "\n",
    "The Filter method is computationally efficient and can handle a large number of features. However, it does not take into account the dependencies between features,\n",

    "Here are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Lasso Regression: Lasso is a regression analysis technique that is used for feature selection and regularization. It can be used to identify the most relevant\n",
